# AI-MovieRecommender
This project features an AI-driven movie recommender conversational system using the Gemini API for generating responses.

- The first part of the project showcases usage of a movie dataset and and catagorization of each movie into a genre to generate results. 
- The second part is developing a system that enables users to engage in dynamic conversations with an AI bot, powered by natural language processing models.
- Conversations are stored in JSON format for future reference and analysis. The project showcases the integration of external APIs, such as the Gemini API, with Python programming, along with the utilization of visualization techniques for displaying conversations.
